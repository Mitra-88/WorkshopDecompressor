## Installation

To install VAE, download the [latest release](https://github.com/VermeilChan/VAE/releases/latest).

- **Windows:** `VAE-2.x.x-Windows-x64.7z`
- **Linux:** `VAE-2.x.x-Linux-x64.tar.xz`
- **macOS:** `VAE-2.x.x-macOS-Arm64.zip`

## Usage

### Step 1: Extract the Downloaded Archive

1. Extract the contents of VAE.
2. Copy the extracted content to the directory where your addons are located. For example:
   - **SteamCMD Path:** `path-to-steamcmd/steamapps/workshop/content/4000`
   - **3rd Party Websites/Programs:** Place VAE in the directory containing your archives or folders. VAE will scan the current directory and any subdirectories.

### Step 2: Run the Program

Upon launching the program, you will be presented with two options:

#### Option 1: Extract Addons

- This option scans the current directory and subdirectories for `.gma` and `.bin` files and extracts them.
  - Navigate to the `Extracted-Addons` folder, and copy the folders to your Garry's Mod Addon directory.

#### Option 2: Extract Archives

- This option scans the current directory for archive files (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.tar.xz`, `.xz` and `.bz2`) and extracts them.

- You can remove the `Leftover` folder, which contains the `.gma` and `.bin` and archives to free up some space.
